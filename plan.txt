Understanding the problem:
  The program prompts a user to enter an integer. A range of integers is created from 1 to the inputted integer. Each number that is fully divisible by both 3 and 5 is replaced 
  with the string "FizzBuzz". Each number only fully divisible by 3 is replaced by the string "Fizz". Each number fully divisible by 5 is replaced by the string "Buzz". The 
  array of numbers is returned to the user with an alert.
  *A fully divisible number is one that has a remained of 0 when divided by the divisor.

Plan:
  The program does not have a UI. It uses a JS prompt on an HTML page to receive input from the user and returns output with a JS alert (popup).

  The program inputs an integer from a JS prompt, entered by the user.

  The desired output is an array of ordered integers from 1 to the user's inputted integer. Certain integers should be replaced by "Fizz", "Buzz" and "FizzBuzz" as described
  above in the "Understanding the problem" section.
  Example:
    User input: 15
    Output: "1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz"
  
  Pseudo code:
    Prompt user to enter an integer. Validate that it's an integer. Return a message if it's not an integer.

    Create a function called fizzBuzz.
      Cycle from 1 to the inputted integer by 1.
        For every integer, add "FizzBuzz" to final result if fully divisible by 3 AND 5. If not, check if fully divisible by 3 and add "Fizz" to final string. If not, check if 
        fully divisible by 5 and if so, add "Buzz" to final string. If none of these conditions work, concatenate current integer to the final string.
      Return final string.
    Show an alert to the user with the results of fizzBuzz function.

Divide and conquer:
  Begin by creating a prompt for the user's input.
