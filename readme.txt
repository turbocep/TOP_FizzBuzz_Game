Fizz Buzz game

This is a program that outputs a string of numbers in terms of the
Fizz-Buzz game. A user is prompted to enter an integer using a JS
prompt. The program creates a range of integers from 1 to the 
user-inputted value. Every integer that is divisible by both 3 and
5 is replaced by the string "FizzBuzz". Every integer that is 
divisible by only 3 is replaced by "Fizz". Finally, every integer
that is divisible by only 5 is replaced by "Buzz". The resulting 
array is returned to the user with a JS alert.

Run the project by opening its index.html file in a browser from 
the "fizzBuzz" folder. You'll be prompted to enter an integer.
